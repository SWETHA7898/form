# Simple Registration Form and Text Area with Character Counter

This project demonstrates the implementation of two tasks:

1. **Registration Form with Validation**: A simple form that validates user input for the Name, Email, and Password fields.
2. **Text Area with Real-time Character Counter**: A text area where users can type a message and see a character counter that updates in real-time.

## Features

### Task 1: Registration Form with Validation

- **Name Field Validation**: Ensures the Name field is not empty. An error message will be displayed if the Name field is left blank.
- **Email Field Validation**: Validates that the Email field contains a valid email address format (e.g., user@example.com).
- **Password Field Validation**: Requires the password to be at least 6 characters long. If the password is shorter than this, an error message will be shown.
- **Submit Button Disabled**: The submit button remains disabled until all fields (Name, Email, and Password) are validated correctly.

### Task 2: Text Area with Real-time Character Counter

- **Character Counter**: Displays the current number of characters typed and the remaining number of characters allowed.
- **Character Limit**: Prevents further typing once the user exceeds the character limit (e.g., 200 characters max).
- **Warning Message**: Displays a warning message if the character limit is exceeded.

## Requirements

- **HTML**: Structure of the registration form and text area.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the form and text area.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for form validation and updating the character counter in real-time.
